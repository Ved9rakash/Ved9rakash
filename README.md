Hi, hope you are doing well. I'm a programmer from India. I started learning coding(c/c++) 3 years ago and i really fell love with it. I'm currently a 2nd year of
C.S engineering student and constantly learning. I know basis of lots of programming languages right now, but serious in c/c++, python and javascript and 
trying to advance and master these languages. I'm learning about networking too and i want to write my own OS (Don't know much it'll take ;/ ).

Hobbies:
- Like to play chess
- Love to code
- Like to gain general knowledge
- Love to play Basketball

A bit relegious here. I love reading Shreemad Bhagwat Geeta and like to know vedic astorlogy.
